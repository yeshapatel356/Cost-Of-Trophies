# Problem Statement
You work in an organisation that manufactures trophies. A trophy will have a definite shape, will be made of a definite metal, and will have a coating layer over it by some specific element. Once a customer comes to your office to place an order, you need to ask for the relevant details, in order to build the exact trophy as per the requirement.
Details you need from a customer are:
1. The shape, and its dimensions. The possible shapes are Sphere, Cylinder, Cube or something abstract which you can consider to be a cuboid.
2. The metal to be used to build the trophy, and its purity percentage. The possible metals are Aluminium, Steel or Copper.
3. The element to be used for the coating layer, and its thickness. The possible elements are Gold, Silver or Bronze. The metals and the coating elements have a fixed price in your organization.
